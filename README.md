# etch-a-sketch
Project: Etch-a-Sketch - From The Odin Project curriculum.

This project will be an implementation of something between a sketchpad and an
Etch-a-Sketch. The basic idea is that there will be a grid of squares on the
browser that will act as the canvas and each individual square can turn
different colors when hovered over it with the mouse, leaving a trail just like
a pen on a paper would.

The project will put all the skills I have learned thus far as part of the
curriculum to the test, as minimal directions are given as to how to go about
completing the project, and only a general guide is provided, meaning that
the implementation of it is up to the developer's interpretation. This project
will have a greater emphasis on manipulating the DOM with JavaScript, as well
as possibly requiring a few more skills not yet learned, making it a bigger
challenge to implement.

By the end of the project, I will expect to have an even better grasp on DOM
manipulation and event handling in order to change the behavior of the HTML
and CSS that make up the web application.
