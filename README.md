# Etch-a-Sketch Project
Project: Etch-a-Sketch - From The Odin Project curriculum.

Having completed the latest version of the project and all of the requirements
stated in the project lesson page of the curriculum, I have gained a much
better understanding of how to go about creating a small project from scratch.

I now feel much more comfortable working my way around HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript in order to create the design and behavior that I need to accomplish
a project. I also got more experience working with event listeners and
manipulating the DOM to achieve the behaviors that I needed each element to do,
as specified by the requirements of the project lesson page.

Additionally, I also gained a better understanding of the Git workflow,
specifically, how to use branches by creating new ones as needed to work
on new features to add to the project and deleting them once they had been
merged back to the main branch.

Finally, for things that I did not completely understand, I gained a better
idea of how to research for solutions to the problems that would arise and ask
for help in The Odin Project Discord server when solutions could not be found.

This project will be an implementation of something between a sketchpad and an
Etch-a-Sketch. The basic idea is that there will be a grid of squares on the
browser that will act as the canvas and each individual square can turn
different colors when hovered over it with the mouse, leaving a trail just like
a pen on a paper would.

The project will put all the skills I have learned thus far as part of the
curriculum to the test, as minimal directions are given as to how to go about
completing the project, and only a general guide is provided, meaning that
the implementation of it is up to the developer's interpretation. This project
will have a greater emphasis on manipulating the DOM with JavaScript, as well
as possibly requiring a few more skills not yet learned, making it a bigger
challenge to implement.

By the end of the project, I will expect to have an even better grasp on DOM
manipulation and event handling in order to change the behavior of the HTML
and CSS that make up the web application.
